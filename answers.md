1. You should assume there will be real credentials at workshop time that work.
2. These should be real simulations
3. We will use the development server for there server. There will be no custom settings needed.
4. Yes, include everything possible I should need to be successful
5. It should be a hello world with a health check. as minimal as possible, this application is not the focal point of the workshop. Provide minimal tests. Again, this application is not going to be discussed. It's just there. 
6. These should be quick timers for the sake of the demo
7. Yes, include error mechanisms in the code to help with the simulations. Be sure to comment them/separate them from the real implementation so they are easily noticable.
